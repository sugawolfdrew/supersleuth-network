Start continuous network monitoring.

Usage: /monitor [duration] [interval]

Example: /monitor 300 60

Steps:
1. Parse duration (seconds) and check interval
2. Initialize monitoring system
3. Start collecting metrics:
   - Bandwidth utilization
   - Latency measurements
   - Packet loss
   - Device count changes
   - System resources
4. Set up alert thresholds
5. Display real-time metrics
6. Log all events and alerts
7. Generate summary when complete
8. Offer to create monitoring report

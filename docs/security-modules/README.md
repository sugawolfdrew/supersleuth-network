# SuperSleuth Security Assessment Modules

This documentation provides comprehensive information about the security assessment modules available in SuperSleuth Network. These modules are designed to be orchestrated by Claude Code based on IT professional requests.

## Module Overview

SuperSleuth's security assessment capabilities are organized into three main modules:

1. **Security Scanner** - Port scanning, service detection, and vulnerability identification
2. **CVE Database** - Vulnerability database integration and CVE lookups
3. **Vulnerability Reporter** - Report generation and formatting for different audiences

## Quick Start for Claude Code

When an IT professional requests security-related diagnostics, you can use these modules individually or in combination:

```python
# Example: Quick security check
from src.diagnostics import security_scanner

# Scan common vulnerable ports
results = security_scanner.scan_common_ports('192.168.1.100', 'all')

# Check for weak services
vulnerabilities = security_scanner.check_weak_services(results)
```

## Module Categories

### 1. Network Scanning Functions
- Port scanning (individual, batch, ranges)
- Service detection and banner grabbing
- SSL/TLS certificate validation

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis Functions
- CVE database queries
- Risk scoring and assessment
- Weak service identification

### 3. Reporting Functions
- Executive summaries
- Technical reports
- Compliance-focused output
- Multiple export formats

## Common Workflows

### Basic Security Assessment
```python
# 1. Scan ports
# 2. Detect services
# 3. Check for vulnerabilities
# 4. Generate report
```

### Compliance Scan
```python
# 1. Full port scan
# 2. Service enumeration
# 3. CVE correlation
# 4. Compliance mapping
# 5. Audit report generation
```

### Incident Response
```python
# 1. Comprehensive port scan
# 2. Baseline comparison
# 3. Anomaly detection
# 4. Evidence collection
# 5. Incident report
```

## Safety and Ethics

All security modules are designed with safety in mind:
- Non-intrusive scanning techniques
- Authorization checks built-in
- Rate limiting on scans
- No exploitation capabilities
- Audit trail generation

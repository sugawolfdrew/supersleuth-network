# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Platform-Specific Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure full compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms with native integrations for each operating system.
# Details:
This task involves implementing platform-specific features and ensuring compatibility:

1. Windows Support:
   - Integrate with WMI for system metrics
   - Implement PowerShell script execution
   - Add Windows Event Log integration
   - Handle Windows-specific networking commands

2. macOS Support:
   - Create CoreWLAN Python bindings for WiFi scanning
   - Implement airport utility wrapper
   - Add macOS-specific security checks
   - Support macOS system monitoring APIs

3. Linux Distribution Compatibility:
   - Test and fix for Ubuntu, RHEL, Debian
   - Handle different network tools (iw vs iwconfig)
   - Support different init systems (systemd, upstart, etc.)
   - Create distribution detection logic

Implementation example for platform detection:
```python
import platform
import subprocess

def get_platform_info():
    system = platform.system()
    if system == 'Windows':
        version = platform.win32_ver()
        return {'system': 'Windows', 'version': version[0], 'details': version}
    elif system == 'Darwin':
        version = platform.mac_ver()
        return {'system': 'macOS', 'version': version[0], 'details': version}
    elif system == 'Linux':
        # Get Linux distribution details
        try:
            import distro
            dist_info = distro.info()
            return {'system': 'Linux', 'distribution': dist_info['id'], 'version': dist_info['version'], 'details': dist_info}
        except ImportError:
            # Fallback if distro module is not available
            return {'system': 'Linux', 'distribution': 'unknown', 'version': platform.release()}
    return {'system': system, 'version': 'unknown'}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test on Windows 10/11 and Server 2019/2022
2. Test on macOS 12+ (Monterey and newer)
3. Test on major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, RHEL, Debian)
4. Validate platform-specific features work correctly
5. Ensure graceful degradation when platform-specific features are unavailable

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Platform Detection and Abstraction Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust platform detection system and abstraction layer that will serve as the foundation for all platform-specific implementations.
### Details:
Create a PlatformManager class that detects the operating system and provides a consistent interface for platform-specific operations. Implement the platform detection logic using the platform module and enhance it with distribution detection for Linux. Define abstract interfaces for system operations that will be implemented differently on each platform. Include methods for executing system commands with appropriate wrappers for each OS. The class should expose a factory method that returns the appropriate platform-specific implementation.

## 2. Implement Windows-Specific Support [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the Windows implementation of the platform abstraction layer with native Windows integrations.
### Details:
Create a WindowsPlatform class that implements the platform abstraction interface. Integrate with Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for system metrics collection using either the wmi or pywin32 package. Implement methods for PowerShell script execution with proper error handling and output parsing. Add Windows Event Log integration for logging and monitoring system events. Develop networking utilities that use Windows-specific commands (netsh, ipconfig) and parse their outputs. Implement registry access methods for configuration storage and retrieval.

## 3. Implement macOS-Specific Support [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the macOS implementation of the platform abstraction layer with native macOS integrations.
### Details:
Create a MacOSPlatform class that implements the platform abstraction interface. Develop Python bindings for CoreWLAN to enable WiFi scanning and management. Implement a wrapper for the airport utility to access wireless network information. Add methods for interacting with macOS-specific security features through the security command-line tool. Create utilities for accessing macOS system monitoring APIs through subprocess calls to commands like top, vm_stat, and system_profiler. Implement support for AppleScript execution for automation tasks that require GUI interaction.

## 4. Implement Linux Distribution Compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the Linux implementation of the platform abstraction layer with support for multiple distributions.
### Details:
Create a LinuxPlatform class that implements the platform abstraction interface. Implement distribution detection logic using the distro package to identify the specific Linux distribution and version. Develop adapters for different network tools (iw, iwconfig, ip, ifconfig) that select the appropriate tool based on availability. Create handlers for different init systems (systemd, upstart, SysV init) to manage services consistently across distributions. Implement package management abstractions that work with apt, yum, dnf, and pacman depending on the distribution. Add filesystem utilities that account for different mount point conventions and filesystem types.

## 5. Implement Cross-Platform Testing and Validation Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive testing and validation suite to ensure consistent behavior across all supported platforms.
### Details:
Develop a test harness that can run the same functional tests across all platforms. Create platform-specific test cases that verify the correct implementation of native features. Implement a validation suite that checks for feature parity across platforms where applicable. Add performance benchmarks to compare operations across different operating systems. Create a compatibility matrix that documents which features are available on which platforms. Implement continuous integration workflows that test on all target platforms using virtual machines or containers where possible. Add a reporting mechanism that highlights platform-specific issues or inconsistencies.

# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Real Security Vulnerability Detection
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create modular security diagnostic tools that Claude Code can orchestrate to perform customized security vulnerability assessments.
# Details:
This task involves implementing modular security vulnerability detection capabilities that Claude Code can combine and customize:

1. Create adaptable security assessment functions as Python modules
2. Implement CVE database lookup functionality as a standalone service
3. Add modular port scanning with service detection
4. Create a flexible vulnerability reporting system

Files to modify:
- src/diagnostics/security_assessment.py

Implementation example for a modular security scanner:
```python
# Example of a modular security scanner function that Claude Code can customize
def scan_for_vulnerabilities(target_ip, scan_type='basic', ports=None, timeout=300):
    """Modular security scanner that can be customized by Claude Code.
    
    Args:
        target_ip (str): The IP address to scan
        scan_type (str): The type of scan ('basic', 'full', 'stealth')
        ports (list): Specific ports to scan, or None for defaults
        timeout (int): Scan timeout in seconds
        
    Returns:
        dict: Structured vulnerability findings
    """
    results = {}
    
    # Port scanning module
    if scan_type in ['basic', 'full']:
        results['open_ports'] = scan_ports(target_ip, ports=ports)
    
    # Service detection module
    if scan_type in ['full']:
        results['services'] = detect_services(target_ip, results['open_ports'])
    
    # Vulnerability checking module
    results['vulnerabilities'] = check_vulnerabilities(target_ip, results.get('services', []))
    
    # CVE enrichment module
    if results['vulnerabilities']:
        results['vulnerabilities'] = enrich_with_cve_data(results['vulnerabilities'])
    
    return results
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test individual security modules in isolation
2. Validate that Claude Code can successfully invoke and combine modules
3. Test module adaptability with different parameters and configurations
4. Verify CVE detection accuracy against reference systems
5. Test performance and resource usage of individual modules
6. Ensure modules can be safely combined without side effects

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement OpenVAS/Nessus Integration Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a modular function that interfaces with OpenVAS or Nessus to perform vulnerability scans on target systems. Design it to be easily invoked and customized by Claude Code.
### Details:
Create a set of modular functions in security_assessment.py that handle different aspects of security scanning. Instead of a monolithic class, implement discrete functions for authentication, target creation, scan configuration, scan execution, and result retrieval. Each function should be well-documented with clear parameters and return values to facilitate Claude Code's understanding. Store configuration parameters in a separate config file to allow for easy customization. Ensure each function has proper error handling, timeout management, and can operate independently.

## 2. Implement CVE Database Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create modular functions to query and retrieve vulnerability information from CVE databases that Claude Code can use to enrich security assessment results.
### Details:
Implement a set of functions for interfacing with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API or similar sources. Create separate functions for fetching vulnerability details by CVE ID, searching for vulnerabilities by keywords, and retrieving severity scores. Implement a local caching mechanism that can be optionally used to reduce API calls. Each function should handle rate limiting, connection errors, and provide clear documentation on usage patterns. Design the functions to be composable, allowing Claude Code to chain them together for complex queries.

## 3. Implement Port Scanning with Service Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create modular functions for network port scanning and service detection that Claude Code can customize and invoke for different security assessment scenarios.
### Details:
Implement a set of functions using libraries like python-nmap or scapy to perform port scanning and service detection. Create separate functions for different scanning strategies (e.g., TCP connect, SYN stealth, UDP) and service detection methods. Each function should accept parameters for customization, such as port ranges, timeout settings, and scan intensity. Include comprehensive documentation that explains the tradeoffs between different scanning methods to help Claude Code make appropriate choices. Ensure all functions include proper authorization checks and ethical boundaries.

## 4. Create Security Assessment Orchestration Examples [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Develop example workflows showing how Claude Code can orchestrate the security assessment modules to perform comprehensive vulnerability assessments.
### Details:
Create a set of example scripts that demonstrate how Claude Code can combine the various security assessment modules for different scenarios. Include examples for basic security audits, comprehensive vulnerability assessments, and targeted security checks. Document the decision points where Claude Code would need to make choices based on the specific security requirements. Implement helper functions that Claude Code can use to manage the workflow between different security modules, such as filtering and transforming results between steps.

## 5. Implement Vulnerability Reporting System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create modular reporting functions that Claude Code can use to generate customized vulnerability reports with different levels of detail and formatting options.
### Details:
Implement a set of functions for generating vulnerability reports from assessment results. Create separate functions for different report components (executive summary, detailed findings, remediation recommendations) and output formats (JSON, HTML, PDF). Design the functions to be composable, allowing Claude Code to generate custom reports by combining different components. Include functions for filtering and prioritizing vulnerabilities based on different criteria (severity, exploitability, affected systems). Add functions for comparing results across multiple scans to identify new, fixed, and persistent vulnerabilities.

## 6. Create Comprehensive Module Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop detailed documentation for all security assessment modules to help Claude Code understand their capabilities, parameters, and appropriate usage patterns.
### Details:
Create comprehensive documentation for all security assessment modules, including function signatures, parameter descriptions, return value formats, and usage examples. Include information about the security implications, performance characteristics, and potential limitations of each module. Document common patterns for combining modules and best practices for different security assessment scenarios. Create a structured index of all available modules to help Claude Code discover relevant functionality. Use docstring formats that are easily parseable by Claude Code.
